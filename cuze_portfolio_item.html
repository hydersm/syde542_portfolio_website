                <h3>Quick Description</h3>
                <p>A couple months ago, a friend approached me with an idea: a 3D puzzle-based game. As an avid gamer myself, I thought it would be interesting to give this idea a jab. </p>
                <p>So over the course of 2 months, I worked with this friend to design and implement the game. We wanted to make this game feel unique and challending. The game is now fully implemented and is pending on being published to the iOS and Android application stores. This page describes the process we went through to arrive to the final product. </p>

                <p>The first step was to develop a couple personas. A persona is a fictional character created to represent a user type that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way. Making persona will help us get a better understanding of our potential users and will help us generate application requirements:

                    <ul>
                        <li>It must be a mobile game. This has several implications:</li>

                <h2 class="page-header">Game Design</h2>
                <p>Before designing the app, I first wanted to design the game. To do this, I explored different options and picked the best based on the requirements and constraints.</p>
                <h3>Maze Type</h3>
                <p>I first explored different maze types. The first maze is inspired from a common toy. It is a maze "wrapped" around a cube. The third maze is based on platform. This can be seen in various video games. The third kind of maze is a complicated maze embedded into a sphere. All three types are shown below:</p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <div class="thumbnail">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/cuze/maze_1.jpg" alt="">
                    <div class="caption">
                        <p>Maze wrapped around a cube.</p>
                    </div>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <div class="thumbnail">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/cuze/maze_3.png" alt="">
                    <div class="caption">
                        <p>A platform-based maze.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <div class="thumbnail">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/cuze/maze_2.jpg" alt="">
                    <div class="caption">
                        <p>A maze embedded in a sphere.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>It wad decided that the first type will be used. This is because the maze is common enough that many players will be able to understand it easily when its ported to a video game. Furthermore, we felt that cube maze is easily scalable to higher difficulties.</p>
                <h3>Player types</h3>
                <p>The next step is to determine the type of character the player will control. There are two options: either a ball or a human character. The two types of characters are shown below:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <div class="thumbnail">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/cuze/player_1.jpeg" alt="">
                    <div class="caption">
                        <p>Ball player</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <div class="thumbnail">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/cuze/player_2.png" alt="">
                    <div class="caption">
                        <p>Human player</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>It was decided that the "character" will be a ball. It makes the game relatable to the original physical toy.</p>
                <h3>Camera Types</h3>
                <p>The next step was to decide on the camera placement. The camera can either be placed right behind the character or from above (as shown below).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <div class="thumbnail">

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>To help the users get a better view of the maze as a whole, the overhead camera was chosen.</p>
                <h3>Control mechanisms</h3>
                <p>Next, the control mechanism must be decided. This can be done in several ways: the ball can be controlled by either the phone gyroscope, a gamepad overlay, or a waypoint system. The three different mechanism are depicted below:</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>To make the game feel unique and interesting, it was decided that the ball will by controlled using the phone's gyroscope.</p>
                <h2 class="page-header">Layout</h2>
                <p>After fully designing the main components of game, the application is design. The layout is first created. Since the application will use the gyroscope to control the ball, the application can only support one type of orientation (portrait or landscape). Otherwise, the phone will constantly change orientation while the user is tilting the phone due to the gyroscope. The two different layouts are shown below. Please note that layouts below are for the main gameplay screen
                (not other screen such as inventory and settings).</p>

                <h3>Storyboard</h3>
                <p>Next, storyboards were created. A storyboard is series of illustration that depict the changes in the application as the user interacts with it. Two storyboards were created: one for the tutorial (when the user first starts the applicaiton up) and one for actual gameplay. The two storyboards are shown below:</p>
