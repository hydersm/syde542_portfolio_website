                <h3>Quick Description</h3>
                <p>A couple months ago, a friend approached me with an idea: a puzzle-based game where the player has to navigate through a maze wrapped around a cube. As an avid gamer myself, I thought it would be interesting to give this idea a jab. </p>
                <p>So over the course of 2 months, I worked with this friend to design and implement the game. We wanted to make this game feel unique and challending. The game is now fully implemented and is pending on being published to the iOS and Android application stores. This page describes the process we went through to arrive to the final product. </p>

                <p>The first step was to develop a couple personas. This will help us get a better understanding of out potential users:

                        <li>During the short free times he has (bus rides, class breaks, etc), he would like play something to relieve his stress.</li>
                        <li>He would like the game to be mentally challenging and engaging.</li>
                        <li>He is a competitive person, so he would like the ability to share his score with his friends.</li>
                        <li>He also wants a battery-saving feature so that he could save some juice for other tasks.</li>
                        <li>Due to the high possibility of interruptions, he would like the ability to pause the game.</li>

                        <li>He tends to enjoy action-based games with alot of explosions and power ups, but his parents would like him to play a game that is mentally engaging.</li>
                        <li>Previously, he really enjoyed games that used the phone's gyroscope (where tilting the phone had an effect on the game).</li>
                        <li>He really enjoys unlocking things in games. Otherwise, there is not motivation to play.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>It must be a mobile game. This has several implications:</li>
